# Game Of Life 
Conway's game of life written in PyQt5 OpenGL

# Todo
- make classes more modular (i.e. quad/box/parameters in methods)
- make cubes instead of quads
- make mouse click == alive
- make an BoxLayout for the OpenGL with buttons (play, stop, next, etc.)
- Draw OpenGL in arrays instead of lines/quads, so draw it all at ones
- make github-pages page
- make bounding boxes, such that you don't have to copy the entire array
- implement new 3d-version
